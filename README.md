This repository contains code and resources for Time Series forecast and analysis using Machine Learning and Deep Learning. 

## Features

- Machine Learning and Deep Learning techniques for time series.
- Easy-to-use examples with [Scikit-Learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/), [Keras](https://keras.io/), and [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/).
- Only four dependencies:
    - [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)
    - [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) (Version 2.0.0)
    - [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
    - [Scikit-Learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/TimeSeries-ML-DL.git
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Dive into the example notebooks in the `examples/` directory to get started with time series analysis.

## Usage
