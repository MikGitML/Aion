This repository contains code and resources for Time Series analysis using Machine Learning and Deep Learning. It's designed to help you get started with time series forecasting and classification tasks. You'll find examples, tutorials, and utility functions to work with time series data effectively.

## Features

- Machine Learning and Deep Learning techniques for time series.
- Easy-to-use examples with [Scikit-Learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/), [Keras](https://keras.io/), and [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/).
- Only four dependencies:
    - [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)
    - [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) (Version 2.0.0)
    - [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
    - [Scikit-Learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/TimeSeries-ML-DL.git
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Dive into the example notebooks in the `examples/` directory to get started with time series analysis.
